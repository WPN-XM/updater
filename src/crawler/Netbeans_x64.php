     * Welcome to another episode of worst-case-scenarios for version scraping. 
     * This time featuring the Netbeans Download page:
     *
     * 1. Because the version information is dynamically loaded and inserted into the page at rendering time,
     *    we can't simply scrape the verson text.
     * 2. Alternative sources?
     *    - There are other sources, including an RSS feed, but the announcement format for a new version isn't really standardized.
     *    - There are no real archive or download listings available.
     * 3. Maybe a two step scraping approach is needed at a later stage:
     *    - firstly, we scrape the main page, to extract the path location of the build_info
     *    - secondly, we construct the path to build_info.js and scrape it, to extract the version from the path of the download  
     * 4. Thanks for wasting my lifetime with this shit. 
     *    It could have been so easy: http://download.netbeans.org/latest_version.json
